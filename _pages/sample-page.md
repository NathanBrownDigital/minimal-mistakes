From lean startups & small businesses to the UX design & marketing strategy behind softwares for the Fortune 100, I **analyze businesses & unlock new growth engines** - each crafted & forecasted around making real profit, not merely around getting more traffic/signups/etc.

**Growth for your business** should be measurable by real profit, meaning actual dollars-both for reporting results and for using math to calculate forecasts of your possible growth strategies

> Traffic (and even leads) are not the same as growth, unless they are also profitable as well as scalable with your industry & business model.

That's where agencies & even startup incubators get it wrong. An SEO or PPC campaign may bring you traffic, but not be your most effective growth channel; a UX Design project may give your product a new look, but simultaneously force you to hire new support staff to handle the influx of inquiries if not properly tested.

> I use market data, revenue forecasting, & every tool at my disposal to design, develop, & distinguish the options for your growth game plan, at the appropriate pace for your business.
